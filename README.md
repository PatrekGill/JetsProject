# Jets Project

## Description

## Technologies Used
Java 1.8, MAC OS, Eclipse IDE, Bash Terminal, and git

## What I Learned
- A bit more about how packages can be used to organize Java projects

## What I Could Do Better
- **Polymorphism**: I feel as though I didn't manage it as well as I could have specifically on the menu system (albeit I have limited OO experience to base this on). Even with planning, my desire to reuse assets seems to lead to maybe more classes then I think are appropriate and a heavy reliance on abstract classes in particular rather then interfaces. Perhaps a better package structure can help make this seem less unruly.
